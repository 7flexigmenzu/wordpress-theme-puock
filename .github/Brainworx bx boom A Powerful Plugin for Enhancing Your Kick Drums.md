# Brainworx bx boom: A Powerful Plugin for Enhancing Your Kick Drums
 
If you are looking for a simple and effective way to make your kick drums sound bigger and better, you might want to check out Brainworx bx boom. This plugin is a stripped-down version of the Brainworx bx\_subsynth, which is a subharmonic synthesizer that adds low-end to any source. bx boom focuses on the kick drum frequency range and allows you to tune, attenuate or boost the impact of your kick drum sound at any point during the audio production workflowâeven after the final mix or within a full drum loop.

bx boom comes in both mono and stereo versions, so you can use it on individual kick drum tracks or on drum submixes or full stereo mixes. It has only two parameters: Boom and Boom Level. Boom lets you choose from three different center frequencies: 32Hz, 48Hz or 64Hz. These are the frequencies that give your kick drum the most punch and power. Boom Level lets you adjust the amount of boost or cut for the selected frequency. You can also use the built-in M/S matrix to process the mid or side signals separately for more stereo control.
 
bx boom uses high-end Brainworx filters to shape the sound without introducing unwanted artifacts or phase issues. It also has a dedicated bypass switch and a mouse-over feature that lets you adjust parameters by turning the mouse wheel over any knob. You can also type in any value directly into the text fields for precise control.
 
bx boom is compatible with all major hosts that support VST, VST3 or RTAS formats, such as Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Cubase 7, FL Studio 12 and more. It is available for both Mac and PC platforms and can be downloaded from [Plugin Alliance](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/bx_boom.html) for $49. You can also try it for free for 14 days with no limitations.

## A Professional Opinion on bx boom
 
bx boom is not only popular among home studio producers and hobbyists, but also among professional engineers and mixers. One of them is Paul White, the editor-in-chief of Sound On Sound magazine, who reviewed bx boom along with another Brainworx plugin, BX\_dynEQ, in July 2009. He wrote:

> "The BX\_boom plugâin is a very simple affair that allows you to boost or cut a specific lowâfrequency band to enhance or attenuate the 'boom' of a kick drum. There are three frequency options: 32Hz, 48Hz and 64Hz, and you can adjust the amount of boost or cut using a single knob. A second knob adjusts the output level to compensate for any level changes caused by the processing. There's also an M/S matrix switch that allows you to process only the mid or side components of a stereo signal â useful if you want to add weight to a kick drum without affecting any lowâfrequency ambience in the sides of the mix."

He concluded:

> "The BX\_boom plugâin is very effective at what it does and can make a huge difference to weakâsounding kick drums."
