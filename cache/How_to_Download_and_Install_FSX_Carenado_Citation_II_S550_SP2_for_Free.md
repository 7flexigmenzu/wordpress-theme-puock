## Step 2: Extract the Add-on File
 
The next step is to extract the add-on file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download these programs for free from their official websites: [https://www.win-rar.com/download.html](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html) or [https://www.7-zip.org/download.html](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
 
Right-click on the Carenado\_Citation\_II\_S550\_SP2.zip file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to Carenado\_Citation\_II\_S550\_SP2". This will create a folder with the same name as the file. Open the folder and you will see two subfolders: "Carenado Citation II S550" and "SimObjects".

The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X. If you have installed FSX in a different location, you need to find it yourself.
 
Once you have found your FSX folder, open it and look for a subfolder called "SimObjects". Open it and then open another subfolder called "Airplanes". This is where you need to copy the add-on folder.
 
Go back to the Carenado\_Citation\_II\_S550\_SP2 folder that you extracted earlier and open the "SimObjects" subfolder. You will see another subfolder called "Airplanes".
