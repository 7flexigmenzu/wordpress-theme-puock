If you want to download Altera Quartus II 8.1 Web Edition for Windows for free, you have two options:
 
1. You can download it from the Intel website[^1^]. However, this version is archived and does not include the latest functional and security updates. You may also need to request a license file from the Self Service Licensing Center[^2^] or contact the Intel FPGA Licensing Support Center[^3^] for assistance.
2. You can upgrade to the latest version of Intel Quartus II Web Edition Design Software, which is also free and does not require a license. This version supports the latest FPGA devices and includes new features and enhancements. You can download it from the FPGA Software Download Center or request a DVD.

Whichever option you choose, you will need to follow the download and install instructions provided on the website. You will also need to install the USB-Blaster driver to connect your FPGA board to your computer.
 
For more information about Altera Quartus II Web Edition Software, you can refer to the following documentation links:

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
Altera Quartus II Web Edition Software is a user-friendly and intuitive tool that allows you to design and program FPGA devices with ease. You can use the graphical user interface (GUI) or the command-line interface (CLI) to create and manage your projects. You can also use the built-in text editor or your preferred text editor to write and edit your HDL code.
 
The software supports various design entry methods, such as schematic, HDL, IP, and system-level design. You can use the IP Catalog to browse and instantiate IP cores from Intel and third-party vendors. You can also use the Platform Designer tool to create and integrate system-level components, such as processors, memories, peripherals, and custom logic.
 
The software also provides various simulation and verification tools, such as ModelSim-Altera Edition, SignalTap II Logic Analyzer, In-System Sources and Probes Editor, and Timing Analyzer. You can use these tools to test and debug your FPGA designs at different stages of the design flow. You can also use the PowerPlay Power Analyzer tool to estimate and optimize the power consumption of your FPGA designs.
 
Once you are satisfied with your FPGA design, you can use the Quartus II Assembler to generate a programming file for your FPGA device. You can then use the Quartus II Programmer to transfer the programming file to your FPGA board via the USB-Blaster cable. You can also use the Quartus II In-System Memory Content Editor to modify the contents of your memory devices on your FPGA board.
